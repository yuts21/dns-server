# DNSRelay
A project of Advanced Labs in Computer Networks.
Provides following features:

1. Domain name query with local domain-name-IP table (DNS Server).
2. If the search result is a normal IP address, the address is returned to the client (Server Function).
3. If the domain name is not found in the table, a query is sent to the Internet DNS server and the result is returned to the client (Relay Function).
